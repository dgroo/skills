# Skills

A collection of custom Claude Code skills.

## Installation

### Option 1: Global install (recommended)

Symlinks skills into `~/.claude/skills/` so they're available as `/skill-name` in every project, on every machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joewalnes/skills.git
cd skills
make install
```

Skills are symlinked, not copied — edits made by Claude in any project write back to this repo, making it easy to commit and push upstream.

To remove:

```bash
make uninstall
```

### Option 2: Plugin install (namespaced)

Install as a Claude Code plugin. Skills are available as `/skills:skill-name`.

```
/plugin install https://github.com/joewalnes/skills
```

### Other commands

```bash
make list       # Show available skills and install status
```

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bug`                | Add a new bug to the project's tracker (alias for `/todo`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `claude-md-add`      | Add a single entry to a CLAUDE.md file with a copy-edit pass — sharpens vague triggers, flags redundancy, picks the right section, preserves the user's voice                                                                                                                                                          |

| `groot-project`      | Bootstrap a project the Derek way — git, `design/` subtree with readiness-by-directory stories, CLAUDE.md skeleton, Makefile, terminal background color (via `/terminal-setup`), optional GitHub remote and gbrain. Coexists with `/project-setup`. Re-runnable                                                        |
| `hello-world`        | A simple test greeting skill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `helping-hands`      | Work through a project's `helping-hands/` items — tasks needing the user's hands, eyes, credentials. Validates each item, extends LLM-side scaffolding, surfaces a single concrete ask. `/helping-hands new <slug>` files a new entry from the canonical template                                                      |
| `idea`               | Capture a quick spark to the project's sparkfile (`design/IDEAS.md`). `/idea <text>` to add, `/idea review` to list, `/idea iterate` to walk each entry                                                                                                                                                                |

| `terminal-setup`     | Set a per-project terminal background color (and optional shell alias) that follows you across iTerm2, Ghostty, Alacritty, Kitty, WezTerm. Records the choice in `.groot-project.toml`; the shell applies it via OSC 11 on `cd`. Successor to `iterm-setup` — handles `[iterm]` → `[terminal]` migration automatically |
| `prior-art`          | 20-minute prior-art check before building a new project — surfaces 1–3 closest existing tools and asks "what's your honest reason to build anyway?"                                                                                                                                                                    |
